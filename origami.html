    <p> camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that 
        bears distinctive fatty deposits known as humps on its back.

         and textiles (fiber and felt from hair). Camels are working animals especially suited to their 
         desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo.</p>
